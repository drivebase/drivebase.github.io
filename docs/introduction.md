# Introduction

Drivebase is a cloud-agnostic file management application. It allows you to manage your files across multiple cloud providers in your own folder structure.

Imagine your digital life scattered across multiple clouds. Your family photos on **Google Drive**, work documents on **Dropbox**, creative projects on **OneDrive**, and archives on **Amazon S3**. Each with its own login, interface, folder structure, and pricing model.

You've likely experienced this frustration:
**"Where did I save that file again? Was it on Drive or Dropbox?"**

This fragmentation creates real challenges:

- **Mental Overhead**: Constantly switching between services and remembering where files are stored
- **Organizational Chaos**: Maintaining different folder structures across multiple platforms
- **Provider Lock-In**: The painful process of migrating when a provider changes pricing or policies
- **Storage Inefficiency**: Paying for premium tiers on one service while having free space on another
- **Inconsistent Experience**: Learning different interfaces, search capabilities, and sharing mechanics

What if your files could live anywhere while appearing exactly where you want them in your own unified organizational system?

This is the promise of Drivebaseâ€”a single folder structure you control, with the freedom to choose where each file physically resides. You decide the storage provider. You break free from cloud fragmentation.
