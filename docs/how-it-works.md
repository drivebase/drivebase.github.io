# How it works


## Overview

Drivebase is a tool that allows you to manage your files across multiple cloud providers. It uses OAuth to authenticate with the cloud providers and then uses the cloud provider's API to upload, download, and delete files.

::: info
You use your own API keys to authenticate with the cloud providers. In this way, you are in control of your own data.
And the data is stored in your own database.

## Step 1: Connect to a cloud provider

From the available providers, you select the one you want to connect to by entering the required credentials.
After that, you add your account to Drivebase by clicking the "Add account" button. You will be redirected to the cloud provider's website to authorize Drivebase to access your files.

You can check [this page](/docs/providers/) for a list of supported providers.

## Step 2: Create a folder structure

You create a folder structure on Drivebase and they are stored in the connected database.

## Step 3: Upload files

You can upload files to Drivebase by dragging and dropping them into the application or by using the upload button.
Before the files are uploaded, you will be asked to select the provider you want to upload the files to.
